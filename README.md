# Virtual Operating System In Java.
- This program acts like a low-level Operating System where each process is another class.
- This program does similar functions and tasks to a Operating System, like calling Kernel, managing memory and devices for each process, and switching processes
- This project was done for ICSI-412, Operating Systems, at the University at Albany.
- These files have a majority of the code:
  - `OS`
  - `Kernel`
  - `Scheduler`
